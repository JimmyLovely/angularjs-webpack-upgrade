# angularjs-webpack-upgrade

This project demonstrates how to upgrade an AngularJS project to become a hybrid Angular and AngularJS application, using Webpack to bundle both of the frameworks together.

The project uses: 
* AngularJS 1.6.6
* Angular 4.3.4
* Webpack 3.5.5

It should be noted that the original AngularJS project followed the Preparation steps as prescribed by the Angular team, this included using:
* Components
* Typescript
* A Module Loader (Webpack)

The motivation for the project was that I couldn't find any good examples of doing this, and the examples from Angular use System JS.

## To run:

1. Clone the repository
2. npm install
3. run webpack-dev-server
